# Insta Message Unsender
We've all sent embarassing messages...

## What it does?
After many tries with browser based unsenders, I tried to create my own version, with a bit more straightforward approach: Take a screenshot, find the message, unsend the message and repeat this until messages can be found.

## Does it actually work?
I would say 95% yes. One of the benefits of this method is that you don't really interact with instagram in the browser, so you won't be caught. It is probably slower, although the unsenders I tried to use never worked for me. This version sometimes skips messages (because of the messages jumping few lines when too many are loaded), but other than that it is great that you can leave it run during the night and it will do its thing.

# How to use it?
!!!Please note that currently only 1440p, 16:9 screens are supported. Why? Because some positions on the screen are hard coded in order to save processing time.

1. Download the files and put them all in the same folder.
2. Open the script, enter your directory
3. Open Instagram in your browser, navigate to the conversation you want your message to be removed from
4. Maximize the browser window
5. Start the script, you have 5 seconds by default to get back to your browser window
6. Watch the cursor movement, if an error occurs (mouse not moving to the correct position), then stop the script from running by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen
7. Adjust the corresponding click locations in the file
8. Try again
9. ???
10. Profit
    
+1. Send me a message if I helped you save some headache
