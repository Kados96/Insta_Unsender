# Insta Message Unsender

We've all sent embarrassing messages...

## What It Does

After trying several browser-based message unsenders with little success, I decided to create my own approach. This script automates the process of:

1. Taking a screenshot  
2. Detecting the message  
3. Unsending the message  
4. Repeating until all messages are removed  

## Does It Actually Work?

✅ **Success Rate:** ~95%  
- Unlike browser-based methods, this script doesn’t interact directly with Instagram, reducing the risk of detection.  
- It runs autonomously, making it useful for long sessions (e.g., overnight).  
- Occasionally, it may skip messages due to Instagram’s chat UI shifting when too many messages load.  

## How to Use

⚠ **Currently, only 1440p (16:9) screens are supported**  
(Specific screen positions are hardcoded for performance reasons.)

### Steps:
1. **Download** and place all files in the same folder.  
2. **Open the script** and set your working directory.  
3. **Open Instagram** in your browser and navigate to the conversation.  
4. **Maximize your browser window.**  
5. **Start the script** (you have 5 seconds to return to the browser).  
6. **Observe the cursor movements.**  
   - If the mouse doesn’t move correctly, stop the script by moving your cursor to the screen edge.  
7. **Adjust the click positions** in the script if needed.  
8. **Run the script again.**  
9. 🎉 **Done!**
